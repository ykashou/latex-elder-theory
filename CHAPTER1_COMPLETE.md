- ✅ Self-contained (can study independently)

### Example Quality:

**Before** (typical textbook):
```
Compute ⟨x,y⟩_E. Answer: 9.826 - 3.223i
```

**After** (our workbook):
```
Step 1: Extract components (λ₁=3, θ₁=π/4, μ₁=1, φ₁=π/6)
Step 2: Compute phase difference (π/4 - π/6 = π/12)
Step 3: Convert to Cartesian (cos(π/12) = 0.966, sin(π/12) = 0.259)
Step 4: Multiply (3 × 0.966 = 2.898, 3 × 0.259 = 0.777)
Step 5: Combine (2.898 + 0.777i)
[... continues for second term ...]
Final: ⟨x,y⟩_E = 9.826 - 3.223i
Interpretation: Magnitude 10.34 shows strong similarity, 
                -18.1° phase shows slight misalignment
```

## 🔬 What's Different

### Main Chapter (Before → After):

**Before**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}[Phase Conservation Laws]
...properties listed...
\end{theorem}
% No proof
```

**After**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}[Phase Conservation Laws]
\label{thm:phase_conservation_laws}\index{Phase Conservation}
% DEPENDENCIES: Definition~\ref{def:elder_space}, ...
...properties listed...
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We establish each conservation law rigorously...

\textbf{Property 1 (Phase Additivity):}
[68 lines of rigorous proof with all steps]

\textbf{Property 2 (Multiplicative Coherence):}
[Complete derivation]

\textbf{Property 3 (Scaling Invariance):}
[Explicit calculation]

\textbf{Property 4 (Hierarchical Preservation):}
[Homomorphism verification]

All four conservation laws are proven.
\end{proof}
```

### What Students Get (NEW):

```latex
\begin{example}[Computing Phase Momentum Conservation]
Let's verify Ψ(x) = Σλᵢ²θᵢ is conserved...

\textbf{Step 1: Initial state at t=0}
x(0) = 2e^(iπ/4)A₁ + 1e^(iπ/3)A₂
λ₁(0) = 2, θ₁(0) = π/4
λ₂(0) = 1, θ₂(0) = π/3

\textbf{Step 2: Compute initial phase momentum}
Ψ(0) = 4·(π/4) + 1·(π/3) = π + π/3 = 4π/3 ≈ 4.189

\textbf{Step 3: Apply Hamilton's equations}
[Shows explicit time evolution]

\textbf{Step 4: Compute Ψ(t)}
[Verifies conservation numerically]

\textbf{Insight}: Conservation requires Σcᵢ = 0 constraint!
\end{example}
```
