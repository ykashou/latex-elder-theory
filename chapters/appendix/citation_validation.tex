\chapter{Citation Validation}

\textit{This appendix validates all citations used throughout the manuscript, ensuring accuracy, relevance, and proper integration with the text. We systematically analyze each reference to confirm its academic validity, appropriateness to the context in which it appears, and consistency with the Elder Theory framework's principles. The citations are organized by thematic area to facilitate cross-checking against the main content, with detailed notes on how each citation supports specific theoretical claims, experimental results, or methodological decisions. This validation process establishes the scholarly foundations of the Elder Theory, situating it within the broader academic landscape while maintaining scientific integrity through proper attribution of intellectual contributions. Through careful verification of all cited works, we ensure that the Elder Theory framework builds appropriately upon existing knowledge while clearly delineating its novel contributions to the field.}

    \item \textbf{Relevance check}: Each citation connects directly to the content it supports.
    \item \textbf{Consistency check}: Author names, publication years, and reference formats are consistent throughout.
    \item \textbf{Integration check}: Citations flow naturally within the text rather than appearing forced.
    \item \textbf{Distribution check}: Citations are balanced across different sections of the manuscript.
    \item \textbf{Attribution check}: Proper credit is given to the original sources of key concepts.
\end{enumerate}

This validation process ensures that all citations in the Elder theory manuscript are accurate, relevant, and properly integrated with the content, providing a strong scholarly foundation for the theoretical framework.
