\caption{Empirical verification of the theoretical complexity bounds established for key Elder system operations. The plots compare the theoretical asymptotic bounds (solid blue) with measured performance metrics (dashed red) for forward pass computation, knowledge transfer operations, orbital dynamics computation, and principle extraction. The measured performance closely follows the theoretical predictions, validating the mathematical complexity analysis. Minor deviations at smaller scales are due to implementation constants and overhead that become negligible at larger scales.}
