## Additional Review Guidelines

1. **Theorem Structure**: All theorems should follow standard mathematical format: Theorem statement, followed by proof, followed by discussion of implications.

2. **Formal Definitions**: All novel mathematical concepts must have formal definitions before they are used in theorems or proofs.

3. **Lemma Organization**: Supporting lemmas should be presented before the main theorems they support.

4. **Proof Technique Clarity**: Each proof should clearly indicate the technique being used (e.g., proof by contradiction, induction).

5. **Edge Case Analysis**: All mathematical results should address relevant edge cases and boundary conditions.

6. **Notation Consistency**: Maintain consistent notation throughout, with a preference for standard mathematical conventions where applicable.

7. **Assumptions**: Clearly state all assumptions for each theorem and proof.

8. **Counter-examples**: Where applicable, provide counter-examples to demonstrate the necessity of conditions.

9. **Numerical Validation**: Include numerical validation for non-trivial mathematical results.

10. **Interdisciplinary Consistency**: Ensure consistent use of terminology across different mathematical disciplines (e.g., differential geometry, information theory).
