# Chapter 5: Advanced Properties of Heliomorphic Functions - Mathematical Proof Review Checklist

## Overview
This checklist evaluates the mathematical rigor and logical consistency of Chapter 5 from the perspective of an artisan mathematician, focusing on proof completeness, logical flow, and mathematical prerequisites.

## Mathematical Proofs Identified

### 1. Theorem: Banach Space Structure (Lines 15-21)

## Recommendations for A-Level Mathematical Rigor

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Complete reconstruction of Theorems 3, 6, 7, 8**
2. **Major revision of Theorems 1, 2, 4, 5**
3. **Add 15-20 supporting lemmas**
4. **Eliminate all circular references**
5. **Define all mathematical objects explicitly**

### Mathematical Prerequisites to Add:
1. **Heliomorphic Function Space Theory** (new section)
2. **Differential Operator Foundations** (expanded section)
3. **Gravitational Field Mathematics** (rigorous section)
4. **Knowledge Representation Formalism** (mathematical section)

### Proof Standards to Meet:
- Every theorem must have complete, self-contained proof

- Rigorous error analysis where applicable

## Priority Level: CRITICAL
This chapter requires extensive mathematical reconstruction to meet A-level academic standards. Current proofs are insufficient for peer review.
