## Priority 4: Gravitational Stratification Proofs

### ❌ Gravitational Field Function Definition
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** Function $G: \mathcal{E}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ used without definition
- **Current:** Theorem 2.2 uses undefined gravitational field strength
- **Required:** Define $G(x) = \|\mathcal{G}(x)\|_E$ with proper norm
- **Dependencies:** Requires gravitational operator from Chapter 1

### ❌ Stratification Existence Proof
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** Claims to follow from "Theorem 1.7" which doesn't exist
- **Current:** Theorem 2.2 - false reference for fundamental result
- **Required:** Independent proof using level set analysis
- **Implementation:** Apply implicit function theorem to $G - g_k = 0$

### ❌ Stratum Smoothness Proof
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** Claims each $\mathcal{S}_k$ is smooth submanifold without proof
- **Current:** Theorem 2.2 Property 1 - unproven claim
- **Required:** Prove using regular value theory for gravitational field function

### ❌ Frontier Condition Proof
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** Boundary condition $\partial \mathcal{S}_k \subset \bigcup_{j < k} \mathcal{S}_j$ unproven
- **Current:** Theorem 2.2 Property 4 - claimed without justification
- **Required:** Analyze limit behavior at stratum boundaries

- **Issue:** "Knowledge Resonance" theorems lack mathematical formulation
- **Current:** Theorems 2.4, 2.6 are purely descriptive
- **Required:** Define resonance measure and prove amplification properties

### ❌ Learning Dynamics Formulation
- **Status:** NOT IMPLEMENTED - NO MATHEMATICAL CONTENT
- **Issue:** Pattern recognition and evolution theorems lack mathematical structure
- **Current:** Theorems 2.7, 2.8 contain no formal dynamic system

## Additional Missing Foundations

## Assessment for Computational Implementation

**Mathematical Soundness:** Concepts appear sound but lack rigorous foundations  
**Implementation Readiness:** Completely blocked - no critical definitions established  
**Topological Completeness:** Major gaps in fundamental topological structure  
**Practical Utility:** Cannot be assessed until mathematical foundations exist

**Recommendation:** Chapter 2 requires complete mathematical reconstruction. The topological insights are potentially valuable for the trainable Elder Heliosystem, but the current presentation lacks the mathematical rigor necessary for computational implementation.
