## Executive Summary

Chapter 4 introduces heliomorphic functions as the mathematical foundation for the Elder Heliosystem. While it provides extensive conceptual framework and establishes connections to Elder Spaces, the chapter suffers from critical mathematical gaps in proof rigor. Most theorems lack complete proofs, relying instead on proof sketches or assertions without rigorous verification.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- 8 out of 10 theorems lack rigorous mathematical proofs
- Core isomorphism theorem has incomplete proof verification
- Axiomatic foundation lacks independence and consistency proofs
- Integration and series expansion theorems provide no mathematical derivations
- Information capacity claims lack quantitative mathematical analysis
