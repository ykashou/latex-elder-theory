### Proof Standards to Meet:

## Priority Level: CRITICAL
This chapter requires extensive mathematical reconstruction to meet A-level academic standards. Current content lacks fundamental mathematical rigor and contains numerous undefined concepts that prevent meaningful mathematical analysis. The Elder Manifold concept needs complete mathematical foundation before any meaningful theorems can be established.
