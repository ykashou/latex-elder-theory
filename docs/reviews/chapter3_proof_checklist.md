## Fundamental Mathematical Gaps

### ❌ Definition Rigor Issues
1. **Elder Parameter Space Definition (Lines 11-28):**
   - Hilbert space structures $\mathbb{H}_E$, $\mathbb{H}_M$, $\mathbb{H}_e$ not characterized
   - Inner products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_E$ not explicitly defined
   - Separability claims need verification

2. **Complex Parameter Representation (Lines 129-157):**
   - Inner product axioms stated but not verified for the specific construction
   - Phase and magnitude operators well-definedness unproven
   - Domain restrictions not specified

3. **Core Coupling Parameters (Lines 205-215):**
   - Mathematical relationships between $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ unspecified
   - Stability-adaptation rate relationship lacks mathematical formulation

   - "Position-dependent influence" not mathematically defined
   - "Inverse-square principles" implementation unspecified
   - "Continuous influence gradients" lack mathematical characterization

### ❌ Logical Consistency Issues
1. **Forward Reference Dependencies:**
   - References to Chapter 4 (heliomorphic functions) before establishment
   - References to Chapter 12 (orbital mechanics) create circular reasoning
   - Theorem 1.2 dependency unclear

2. **Structural Contradictions:**
