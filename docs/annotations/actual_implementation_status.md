- ❌ Annotation 42: Improve plot design (visual improvements needed)
- ❌ Annotation 48: Format spacing fix (simple formatting)
- ❌ Annotation 51: Orbital entropy statement (need to find and correct)
- ❌ Annotation 55: Explain indicator function (need clearer notation)
- ❌ Annotation 56: Learning rate stabilization (need mathematical elaboration)
- ✅ Annotation 57: Feedback quantification (COMPLETED - added tensor formulation)
- ✅ Annotation 60: Chapter expansion (verified - already exists as separate file)

## Realistic Current Status:
- Completed: 18/28 annotations (64%)
- Still needed: 10/28 annotations (36%)
