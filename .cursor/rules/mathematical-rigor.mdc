# Mathematical Rigor Rules for Elder Theory

## Theorem-Definition-Proof Structure

### Every Theorem MUST Have:
1. ✅ **Formal statement** with numbered label
2. ✅ **Complete proof** (no "proof omitted" or "trivial")
3. ✅ **Dependencies listed** (which theorems/lemmas it uses)
4. ✅ **Forward references** tracked (what depends on this)

### Proof Completeness Checklist:
```latex
\begin{theorem}[Theorem Name]
\label{thm:unique_label}
Statement of theorem with all assumptions explicitly stated.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
1. State all assumptions
2. Identify which prior results are used
3. Show each logical step
4. Identify where key insights occur
5. Conclude with ∎ or \qed
\end{proof}
```

## Proof Gap Detection

### Red Flags (NEVER acceptable):
- ❌ "The proof is straightforward"
- ❌ "It can be shown that..."
- ❌ "Obviously..."
- ❌ "Clearly..."
- ❌ "By direct calculation..." (without showing calculation)
- ❌ "The rest follows similarly"

### Required Explicitness:
- ✅ Show ALL steps for first instance
- ✅ If pattern repeats, state: "By identical argument..."
- ✅ Reference specific equations/theorems by number
- ✅ State when using axioms vs derived results

## Dependency Tracking

### Theorem Dependencies MUST Be:
1. **Tracked**: Which theorems depend on which definitions/lemmas
2. **Acyclic**: No circular dependencies
3. **Minimal**: Don't cite stronger results when weaker suffice
4. **Explicit**: State dependencies in proof

### Example:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof using Theorem~\ref{thm:heliomorphic_completeness}]
By Theorem~\ref{thm:heliomorphic_completeness}, the heliomorphic 
function space is complete. Applying this with Definition~\ref{def:elder_space}...
\end{proof}
```

## Assumption Verification

### Every Proof MUST:
- ✅ List ALL assumptions at start
- ✅ Verify assumptions are met before applying theorems
- ✅ State domain restrictions explicitly
- ✅ Identify which results require which assumptions

### Common Pitfalls:
- ❌ Assuming convergence without proving it
- ❌ Assuming continuity/differentiability without stating
- ❌ Assuming existence without construction
- ❌ Assuming uniqueness without proof

## Notation Consistency

### Before Using New Notation:
1. ✅ Check if already defined in `macros/math_macros.tex`
2. ✅ If new, add to macros file with comment
3. ✅ Never redefine existing notation
4. ✅ Add to consolidated notation appendix

## Counterexample Requirements

### When Stating "X does not hold":
- ✅ Provide explicit counterexample
- ✅ Show calculation demonstrating failure
- ✅ Explain why counterexample is minimal

## Edge Case Coverage

### Proofs MUST Address:
- ✅ Boundary cases (n=0, n=1, limiting cases)
- ✅ Degenerate cases (zero measure, empty set)
- ✅ Infinite/unbounded cases (when relevant)
- ✅ Singular points/discontinuities

## Mathematical Writing Style

### Definitions:
```latex
\begin{definition}[Concept Name]
\label{def:unique_label}
A [object] is a [mathematical structure] satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Property 1
    \item Property 2
    \item ...
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
```

### Theorems:
```latex
\begin{theorem}[Descriptive Name]
\label{thm:unique_label}
Let [assumptions]. Then [conclusion].
\end{theorem}
```

### Lemmas (Auxiliary Results):
```latex
\begin{lemma}[Purpose of Lemma]
\label{lem:unique_label}
Statement of auxiliary result used in main theorem.
\end{lemma}
```

### Corollaries (Immediate Consequences):
```latex
\begin{corollary}[What It Shows]
\label{cor:unique_label}
As an immediate consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm:main}, we have...
\end{corollary}
```

## Proof Techniques Documentation

### When Using Standard Techniques:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Induction]
\textbf{Base case:} ...
\textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} ...
\textbf{Inductive step:} ...
Therefore by induction...
\end{proof}
```

```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Contradiction]
Assume toward contradiction that...
[Derive contradiction]
This contradicts [known fact], therefore...
\end{proof}
```

```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Construction]
We explicitly construct... Define x as follows:
[Construction steps]
We verify the required properties:
[Verification]
\end{proof}
```

## Quantifier Precision

### Universal Quantification:
✅ "For all x ∈ X, property P(x) holds"
❌ "Property P(x) holds" (implicit quantifier unclear)

### Existential Quantification:
✅ "There exists x ∈ X such that P(x)"
✅ "There exists a unique x ∈ X such that P(x)"
❌ "We can find x where P(x)" (vague)

## Equation Numbering

### Number Important Equations:
```latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:important_result}
f(x) = \int_0^x g(t) dt
\end{equation}
```

### Reference by Number:
```latex
By equation~\eqref{eq:important_result}, we have...
```

### Don't Number Trivial Steps:
```latex
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 5 \\
2x + 2y &= 10
\end{align*}
```
