- [ ] Induction properly structured (base + inductive step)
- [ ] Contradiction arguments well-formed

## Common Proof Pitfalls

### 1. Quantifier Confusion
❌ **Wrong**:
```latex
For some x, P(x) holds. Therefore Q(x) holds for all x.
```

✅ **Correct**:
```latex
Let x ∈ X be arbitrary. We show P(x) ⇒ Q(x). 
Since x was arbitrary, Q(x) holds for all x ∈ X.
```

### 2. Assuming What You're Proving
❌ **Wrong**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}
The function f is continuous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since f is continuous, for all ε > 0...
\end{proof}
```

✅ **Correct**:
```latex
\begin{proof}
Let ε > 0 be arbitrary. We show there exists δ > 0 such that
|x - x₀| < δ ⇒ |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε.

Choose δ = ε/2. Then for |x - x₀| < δ:
[derivation showing |f(x) - f(x₀)| < ε]

Therefore f satisfies the ε-δ definition of continuity.
\end{proof}
```

### 3. Insufficient Edge Case Coverage
❌ **Wrong**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}
For all n ∈ ℕ, P(n) holds.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For n = 5, we have... Therefore P(n) holds. ∎
\end{proof}
```

✅ **Correct**:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Induction]
\textbf{Base case (n=0):} P(0) holds because...

\textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} Assume P(k) for some k ≥ 0.

\textbf{Inductive step:} We show P(k+1).
[Using P(k), derive P(k+1)]

By induction, P(n) holds for all n ∈ ℕ.
\end{proof}
```

### 4. Existential Without Construction
❌ **Wrong**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}
There exists x ∈ X such that P(x).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Clearly such an x exists. ∎
\end{proof}
```

✅ **Correct**:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Explicit Construction]
Define x = [explicit formula or procedure].

We verify P(x):
[Step-by-step verification that x satisfies P]

Therefore x ∈ X and P(x) holds.
\end{proof}
```

### 5. Confusing "If" and "Only If"
❌ **Wrong**:
```latex
\begin{theorem}
f is continuous if and only if f⁻¹(U) is open for all open U.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If f⁻¹(U) is open for all open U, then f is continuous.
[proof of forward direction only]
∎
\end{proof}
```

✅ **Correct**:
```latex
\begin{proof}
(⇒) Assume f is continuous. Let U be open...
[prove f⁻¹(U) is open]

(⇐) Assume f⁻¹(U) is open for all open U...
[prove f is continuous]

Therefore f is continuous ⇔ f⁻¹(U) is open for all open U.
\end{proof}
```

## Proof Techniques with Templates

### Direct Proof:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Direct Proof]
Assume [hypothesis H]. We show [conclusion C].

From H, we have [fact 1].
By [theorem/lemma], [fact 2].
Combining these, [fact 3].
Therefore C holds.
\end{proof}
```

### Proof by Contradiction:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Contradiction]
Assume toward contradiction that ¬C (i.e., [negation of conclusion]).

From this assumption, [derive fact 1].
By [reasoning], [derive fact 2].
But this contradicts [known fact K from hypothesis or prior theorem].

Therefore our assumption ¬C must be false, so C holds.
\end{proof}
```

### Proof by Induction:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Induction]
\textbf{Base case:} For n = 0 [or n = 1], we have
[direct verification of P(0)]

\textbf{Inductive hypothesis:} Assume P(k) holds for some k ≥ 0.
That is, assume [explicit statement of P(k)].

\textbf{Inductive step:} We prove P(k+1).
[Using P(k), derive P(k+1)]

By the principle of mathematical induction, P(n) holds for all n ∈ ℕ.
\end{proof}
```

### Strong Induction:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Strong Induction]
\textbf{Base case:} Verify P(0) and P(1).

\textbf{Strong inductive hypothesis:} 
Assume P(j) holds for all 0 ≤ j ≤ k.

\textbf{Inductive step:} We show P(k+1).
[Use any/all of P(0), P(1), ..., P(k) to derive P(k+1)]

By strong induction, P(n) holds for all n ≥ 0.
\end{proof}
```

### Proof by Construction:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Explicit Construction]
We construct x ∈ X satisfying property P as follows:

\textbf{Construction:} Define
\begin{equation*}
x = [explicit formula or algorithmic procedure]
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Verification:} We verify x satisfies P.

\textit{Property 1:} [Show x satisfies property 1 of P]

\textit{Property 2:} [Show x satisfies property 2 of P]

Therefore x satisfies P.
\end{proof}
```

### Proof by Cases:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Cases]
We consider all possible cases:

\textbf{Case 1:} Assume [condition 1].
[Proof that conclusion holds in this case]

\textbf{Case 2:} Assume [condition 2].
[Proof that conclusion holds in this case]

\textbf{Case 3:} Assume [condition 3].
[Proof that conclusion holds in this case]

Since these cases exhaust all possibilities, the result holds.
\end{proof}
```

### Proof by Contrapositive:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Proof by Contrapositive]
We prove the contrapositive: ¬C ⇒ ¬H.

Assume ¬C, i.e., [negation of conclusion].
[Derive consequences]
Therefore ¬H, i.e., [negation of hypothesis].

Since ¬C ⇒ ¬H, by contraposition we have H ⇒ C.
\end{proof}
```

## Verification After Writing Proof

### Mathematical Verification:
```bash
# Check all referenced labels exist
grep "\\ref{" chapter.tex | while read ref; do
    label=$(echo $ref | sed 's/.*\\ref{\([^}]*\)}.*/\1/')
    grep -q "\\label{$label}" chapters/**/*.tex || echo "Missing label: $label"
done

# Check for undefined citations
grep "\\cite{" chapter.tex | while read cite; do
    key=$(echo $cite | sed 's/.*\\cite{\([^}]*\)}.*/\1/')
    grep -q "^@.*{$key," bibliography.bib || echo "Missing citation: $key"
done
```

### Logical Verification Checklist:
1. ✅ Read proof backward (conclusion → premises)
2. ✅ Check each "therefore" has justification
3. ✅ Verify no hidden assumptions in notation
4. ✅ Ensure uniqueness claimed only when proven
5. ✅ Check quantifiers match claimed result
6. ✅ Verify all cases covered in case analysis
7. ✅ Check induction base case proven
8. ✅ Verify contradiction actually contradicts something

### Peer Review Questions:
- **Clarity**: Can I follow every step?
- **Completeness**: Are there any unexplained jumps?
- **Insight**: Do I see where key insights occur?
- **Rigor**: Are edge cases handled?
- **Correctness**: Is the logic sound?

## Special Considerations for Elder Theory

### Heliomorphic Function Proofs:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Heliomorphic Proof Pattern]
Let f : \elder{d} → \elder{k} be heliomorphic.

\textbf{Phase preservation:} We show Φ(f(x ⋆ y)) = Φ(f(x)) · Φ(f(y)).
[Verification using phase operator properties]

\textbf{Magnitude growth:} We bound |f(x)|.
[Use gravitational field operator bounds]

\textbf{Completeness:} We show f is well-defined on completion.
[Use Cauchy sequence argument]

Therefore f satisfies the heliomorphic properties.
\end{proof}
```

### Gravitational Dynamics Proofs:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Orbital Mechanics Proof Pattern]
Consider Elder entity E with gravitational field G_E.

\textbf{Energy conservation:} We verify conservation of
E_total = E_kinetic + E_potential.
[Show dE/dt = 0]

\textbf{Stability:} We show orbital parameters remain bounded.
[Use Lyapunov function]

\textbf{Resonance:} We characterize resonant frequencies.
[Solve characteristic equation]

Therefore the orbital system is stable.
\end{proof}
```

### Information-Theoretic Proofs:
```latex
\begin{proof}[Information Theory Proof Pattern]
Let I(X;Y) denote mutual information.

\textbf{Entropy bound:} We establish H(X) ≤ log|X|.
[Use definition of entropy]

\textbf{Information transfer:} We bound I(X;Y) ≤ min(H(X), H(Y)).
[Use data processing inequality]

\textbf{Learning bound:} We show error decreases with O(1/n).
[Apply PAC learning framework]

Therefore the learning algorithm is efficient.
\end{proof}
```

## Proof Anti-Patterns (Never Do This)

### ❌ Hand-Waving:
```latex
\begin{proof}
It is obvious that... The rest is straightforward. ∎
\end{proof}
```

### ❌ Proof by Authority:
```latex
\begin{proof}
According to [famous mathematician], this must be true. ∎
\end{proof}
```

### ❌ Proof by Intimidation:
```latex
\begin{proof}
The proof is left as a trivial exercise for the reader. ∎
\end{proof}
```

### ❌ Circular Reasoning:
```latex
\begin{proof}
A is true because B is true.
B is true because A is true. ∎
\end{proof}
```

### ❌ Proof by Example:
```latex
\begin{theorem}
For all n ∈ ℕ, property P(n) holds.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For n = 1, 2, 3, we have verified P(n). ∎
\end{proof}
```
