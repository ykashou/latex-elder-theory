## Cross-Domain Integration Requirements

### Mentor-Level Datasets
**Function**: Knowledge transfer between Erudite domains

**Required Datasets**:
- Cross-modal association data linking visual and auditory elements

### Processing Requirements
- **Spectral Analysis**: Detailed frequency domain characterization
- **Temporal Analysis**: Precise timing and rhythm extraction
- **Spatial Analysis**: Three-dimensional positioning and movement data
- **Semantic Labeling**: Contextual and emotional classification

## Implementation Notes

The datasets must support the heliomorphic function representation established in our mathematical framework, where each sound effect f(r,θ) can be decomposed into magnitude ρ(r,θ) and phase φ(r,θ) components that satisfy the coupling parameter constraints.

Each Erudite's dataset must include sufficient variation to populate its assigned region of Elder Parameter Space while maintaining the gravitational field interactions necessary for cross-domain knowledge transfer through the Mentor system.

The Elder's orchestration capabilities depend on having access to meta-patterns that emerge from the combined Erudite datasets, requiring careful curation to ensure narrative coherence emerges naturally from the mathematical framework rather than being artificially imposed.
