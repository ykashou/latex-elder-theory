# Elder Theory Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the mathematical review checklist items in strict order.

## Current Task:
**Category**: Core Mathematical Foundations  
**Task**: Derive Elder-Mentor-Erudite mass ratio requirements  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Demonstrate how optimal mass ratios emerge naturally from acquired system knowledge rather than being arbitrarily prescribed, with mathematical proof of self-organization
