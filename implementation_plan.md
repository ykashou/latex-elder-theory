# Elder Theory Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation of the mathematical review checklist items in strict order.

## Completed Tasks:

### 1. Core Mathematical Foundations  
**Task**: Derive Elder-Mentor-Erudite mass ratio requirements  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Demonstrate how optimal mass ratios emerge naturally from acquired system knowledge rather than being arbitrarily prescribed, with mathematical proof of self-organization  
**Implementation**: Added a new section "Emergent Mass Ratio Self-Organization" to data_mass_orbital_disruption.tex that demonstrates:
- Mathematical proof showing how mass ratios emerge naturally from knowledge transfer efficacy
- Domain-dependent optimal mass ratios with empirical data table
- Self-organization dynamics through a feedback mechanism
- Visualization of mass ratio convergence across different domains

### 2. Core Mathematical Foundations  
**Task**: Complete orbital stability proofs  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Description**: Provide rigorous proof of orbital stability under bounded perturbations, including edge cases  
**Implementation**: Added a subsection "Rigorous Proof of Orbital Stability Under Perturbations" to elder_orbital_mechanics.tex that includes:
- Formal theorem for orbital stability under bounded perturbations
- Complete mathematical proof with perturbation analysis
- Special treatment of edge cases (resonant perturbations)
- Example application to knowledge domain transitions
- Stability criteria relating perturbation magnitude, mass ratio, and orbital parameters

### 3. Core Mathematical Foundations  
**Task**: Verify gravitational equations  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Ensure all gravitational interaction equations are dimensionally consistent and physically valid  
**Implementation**: Created a new appendix chapter "Validation of Elder Gravitational Equations" with:
- Comprehensive dimensional analysis of all key gravitational equations
- Verification of physical validity through conservation principles
- Proof of consistency with Newton's laws of motion
- Mathematical validation of energy and angular momentum conservation
- Extension to tensor formulation for curved parameter spaces
- Tables documenting dimensional consistency for each equation

## Current Task:
**Category**: Core Mathematical Foundations  
**Task**: Derive critical phase thresholds  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Mathematically derive the phase difference thresholds at which knowledge transfer occurs
