Bottom left: Experimental validation shows that actual convergence times (black dots) fall between theoretical upper (red) and lower (blue) bounds, confirming the tightness of our bounds. Bottom right: Multi-domain convergence acceleration demonstrates that as more domains are learned, convergence time decreases significantly, with the fifth domain requiring only 38\% of the time needed for the first domain. This acceleration follows our theoretical model based on domain similarity and knowledge transfer.}}{753}{figure.caption.107}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {65.3}{\ignorespaces Convergence rates across multiple domains in the Elder system. Top: Loss curves for five different domains demonstrate accelerated convergence for later domains due to knowledge transfer. The convergence time $T_i$ for each domain decreases consistently, with Domain 5 converging 62\% faster than Domain 1. Bottom left: Domain similarity matrix shows pairwise similarities, with higher similarities yielding greater convergence acceleration. Domain 5 (Audio) benefits from strong similarity to Domain 3 (NLP). Bottom right: Comparison between resonant and non-resonant systems shows a 37\% convergence speedup from optimal resonance configuration (Elder-Mentor 3:1, Mentor-Erudite 2:1). These experimental results closely match the theoretical predictions from our convergence guarantees analysis.}}{754}{figure.caption.108}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {66.3}{\ignorespaces Knowledge transfer process in the Elder system. The process begins with computing similarity between source and target domains. From the source domain, universal principles are extracted from the Elder entity, while meta-knowledge is extracted from the Mentor entity. These, along with domain similarity information, are used to create an isomorphism mapping between domains. This mapping is then applied to transform source domain Erudite parameters into appropriate initial parameters for the target domain. The transformed parameters are adapted to the target domain's specific characteristics, and then the entire system is fine-tuned on target domain data. Throughout this process, the universal principles in the Elder entity remain largely invariant across domains, while the meta-knowledge in the Mentor entity is partially shared. This hierarchical knowledge transfer mechanism allows the Elder system to leverage knowledge from previously learned domains to accelerate learning in new domains, with transfer efficiency proportional to domain similarity. The knowledge mapping formally defines how knowledge structures, input features, and functions are transformed between domains.}}{763}{figure.caption.111}%
