This part establishes the foundational mathematical structures and theoretical framework necessary for understanding the Elder mathematical symphony. We begin by introducing the core concepts behind the Go-Elder monorepo and its component packages, then develop the representation theory required for the Elder formalism. Several key theorems are presented to provide a rigorous basis for the concepts implemented in the Go packages.

The material is organized into fundamental units, each building upon previous results to form a cohesive computational framework.
