# Elder Theory Proof Completion Tracking

**Document Version**: Elder Theory - Comprehensive Mathematical Framework  
**Tracking Period**: September 11, 2025  
**Objective**: Complete and verify all mathematical proofs for journal publication readiness

## Overview

This document tracks every change made to mathematical proofs in the Elder Theory framework, providing detailed justifications for each modification. All changes are categorized by theoretical unit and proof type, ensuring comprehensive coverage and academic rigor.

## Change Categories

- **CRITICAL**: Foundational proofs affecting core theoretical validity
- **MAJOR**: Significant proofs supporting key theoretical claims  
- **MINOR**: Refinements improving mathematical clarity or notation
- **DEPENDENCY**: Changes required to resolve theorem dependency issues

## Tracking Log
