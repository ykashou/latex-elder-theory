# Workbook Enhancement Plan - Based on Original

## What We're Keeping (What Worked):
✓ Single flowing document (not fragmented modules)
✓ Concrete worked examples with actual numbers
✓ Clear step-by-step arithmetic
✓ Good pedagogical flow
✓ 37 pages of solid content

## What We're Adding:
1. Fix ALL first-person language (19 done, ~68 remaining)
2. Add 3 Critical Thinking Questions (fully written, not templates):
   - CQ1 after Section 2 (Phase Operators): ~3 pages
   - CQ2 after Section 5 (Hierarchical Subspaces): ~3 pages  
   - CQ3 after Section 7 (Complexity): ~3 pages
3. Add 20+ more exercises with complete solutions: ~10 pages
4. Add 5 coding exercises (Golang + OpenCL) with full code: ~8 pages
5. Expand common mistakes section: ~2 pages

Target: 37 + 9 + 10 + 8 + 2 = ~66 pages (manageable, focused, complete)

## Approach:
- Work on actual file student_workbook_chapter1_enhanced.tex
- Add real content, not placeholders
- Keep the good structure and flow from original
- Every addition is complete and usable
