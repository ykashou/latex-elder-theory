% Unit 1 of "Elder"

\unit{Basic Structures and Notation}

\begin{center}
\textit{In this unit, we establish the foundational structures and notation that will be used throughout the text. We introduce the concept of Elder as a digital symphony and develop the basic tools necessary for understanding the Go-Elder monorepo architecture.}

\begin{chaptersummary}
Unit 1 provides the necessary background for understanding the mathematical formalism used in the Elder implementation. Chapter 1 introduces the basic notation and definitions, while Chapter 2 explores the fundamental properties of Go-Elder packages and their relationship to computational mathematics.
