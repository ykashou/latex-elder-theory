# Elder Theory: The Arcane Realization

A novel mathematical framework for multi-domain learning and knowledge representation.

## About This Project

"Elder Theory: The Arcane Realization" is a comprehensive mathematical textbook that introduces a theoretical framework for hierarchical knowledge representation and multi-domain learning. The book presents the Elder-Mentor-Erudite system, which models how learning occurs at different levels of abstraction through orbital dynamics and gravitational interactions.

## Building the Document

### Prerequisites

- A full LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeXLive, MikTeX)
- `biber` for bibliography processing
- GNU Make for using the Makefile

### Compilation Commands

The included Makefile provides several convenient targets:

```bash
# Full build with bibliography, index, and all references
make

# Quick build without rebuilding references
make quick

# Clean auxiliary files but keep PDFs
make clean

# Clean everything including PDFs
make realclean

# Watch for changes and automatically rebuild
make watch
```

The compiled PDF will be available as `build/pdf/elder_arcane_realization.pdf`.

## Editing Guidelines

### Adding a New Chapter

1. Create a new `.tex` file in the appropriate subdirectory under `chapters/`
2. Add an `\input{}` command in `main.tex` at the appropriate position
3. Follow the established chapter structure:
   - Begin with `\chapter{Title}`
   - Include a concise abstract
   - Use consistent section numbering
   - End with a chapter summary using `\chaptersummary{}`

### Mathematical Notation

Custom mathematical notation for Elder Theory is defined in `macros/math_macros.tex`. Please use these consistent macros rather than defining new commands for the same concepts.

Key notation includes:
- `\elder{d}` - Elder space of dimension d
- `\realization{X}` - Realization mapping of entity X
- `\elderloss`, `\mentorloss`, `\eruditeloss` - Loss functions

### Figures and Diagrams

- Place all figures in the `figures/` directory
- Use TikZ for diagrams when possible for consistent styling
- Use the Elder color scheme defined in `main.tex`

## Content Guidelines

- Maintain mathematical rigor with formal definitions, theorems, and proofs
- Include concrete examples to illustrate abstract concepts
- Ensure consistency in terminology throughout the document
- Add new terms to the glossary and index
